# second-coding-challenge
This is the second challenge of the weekly challenge series !!

## Challenge Description
So, There is a decimal number :

                16791573288892525934609440079317541905554393653557736896280802239551592289061061348368963
                
whose binary representation contains fixed quantity of binary number groups and the fixed quantity is also **minima of this equation** : 

                                                 y = x^7 - 117649x

Now , the given clue to solve this problem is that , the binary group also can be converted to a certain famous melody. 

## How can I win ?
to win this challenge you have to tell me the output melody/music name && also the equation needs to be solved programmatically in node enviorement which needs to be submitted to me ! Any kind of Library can be used to complete this coding challenge !!
### finally
After getting the solved code from the required problem, you need to use that code as input to get final instruction which will have final clue to find the **melody**. There is a file called **getReward.js**
which needs to be run to get things going . after installing npm packages mentioned in the package.json dependency (or just simple **npm i** will be suffice ) make sure to run **npm run reward** or **node getReward.js** and you will be asked to give password input.
whoever will be winning, will be featured in the page for one week !

## wait......
Please don't cheat as that will be making the fun timid ! The submission time is valid until monday midnight GMT !!
